# Father
> If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
> _Luke 11:11-13_

We can ask, talk, tell, confide, because He is our Father.
# Hallowed
> Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
> _Psalms 24:3-4_

Our Father, but also Holy. Our conversation should cause us to recognize where we fall short, motivate us to strive to be more like Him, and realize His grace.
# Kingdom Come
> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
> _Luke 17:20-21_

A recognition of not only His Holiness, but also His sovereignty. Our desire should be to align our requests with our knowledge of His will. Those that pray for the hasening of an earthly reign miss the point. The kingdom of God is within us.
# Give Us
> If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
> _John 14:14_

The focus is on our immediate (daily) needs. Our prayer life should tend toward continuous dependence on Him, not the 'give me the portion...that falleth to me' of the younger son. Our requests must recognize the name in which we're asking, and not 'ask amiss'.
# Forgive
> Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.
> _Matthew 18:27-28_

Prayer should prompt the realization that our heavenly relationship is intended to impact our earthly relationships, and be a very real part of aligning our actions with those of our Lord.
# Lead
> A man's heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps.
> _Proverbs 16:9_

An acknowledgment of our limited perception, perspective, and planning. We must devise our way, but prayer rests our confidence not in the wisdom of our heart, but the direction of a sovereign God.

# Kingdom
> But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
> _Philippians 4:19_

The limiting factor is never the resources of our heavenly Father. Those riches are converted to earthly supply through Christ.
# Power
> And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
>And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.
> _Luke 15:29.31_

To have everything that is the Father's, but not utilize it. The 'power to eat thereof' is a heavenly gift we should ask for.

# Glory
> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
> _John 14:13_

Our desire should follow the pattern of Christ's life - that the Father may be glorified. If our requests must not be in conflict with God's glory.
